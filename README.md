### mail-message-count

![AppleScript mail message count](/img/mail-message-count.png?raw=true "AppleScript mail message count")

The script shows message count for each mailbox in all accounts. The information is displayed in the log. You can get all messages count, or only unread ones, or only flagged ones by re-commenting corresponding lines.

### ping-and-reconnect

This one pings some website URL to check internet connection, and if ping fails, then script restarts the network interface (turns off and on again). It helps when you are connected via WiFi and suddenly everything loses connection.
